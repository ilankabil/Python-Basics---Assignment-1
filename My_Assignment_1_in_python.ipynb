        "# Python Basic questions and answers:-\n",
        "\n",
        "1.What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python is an high level interperted programming language, it is known for its readability and ease of use.\n",
        "- It have created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Why python is popular means:-\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Python is free and open source, it is free to use and its source code can be modified.\n",
        "  - it is an interpreted language it runs line by line, which is minimal for debugging and testing.\n",
        "  - Easy to read and understand and its english is like syntax that makes it easy to write and read code.\n",
        "  - it is an object oriented Programming Language which Supports OOP principles like classes etc..\n",
        "  - hundreds of libraries and frameworks, it Offers powerful libraries like NumPy, Django, TensorFlow for faster development.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "- An interpreter is a computer program that reads code written in a high-level language and converts it into machine language so the computer can understand it. It works by translating and running the code line by line, which makes it slower than other methods. This process is called interpretation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Interpreter working:-\n",
        " - Read the code\n",
        " - Translate  \n",
        " - Execute\n",
        " - Repeat\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " - Pre-defined keywords in Python are special words that Python already understands and uses to do certain tasks.You can’t make your own meaning for them or use them as names for things like variables.\n",
        " - Example: if, else, for, while, True, False.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        "- No, you cannot use keywords as variable names in python\n",
        "- Becausae of, python keywords are reserved words that have special meanings in the language syntax. Using them as variable names would confuse the interpreter.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Mutability in Python means whether you can change something after you create it. List is mutable, String cannot be mutable.\n",
        "  - Mutable → You can change it later.\n",
        "  - Immutable → You cannot change it once its made.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Lists are mutable because Python lets you change, add, or remove items after you make them.\n",
        "  - Designed for dynamic data.\n",
        "  - Resizable in memory.\n",
        "- Tuples are immutable because once you create them, you cannot change their items.\n",
        "  - Tuples take up less memory and are slightly faster than lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- \"==\" Operator (Equality) (Comparsion Operator)\n",
        "  - Checks if values are equal.\n",
        "  - Compares the contents of two objects.\n",
        "  - Returns True if the values look the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "- \"is\" Operator (Identity Operator)\n",
        "  - Checks if two variables point to the same object in memory.\n",
        "  - Compares the identity (memory address), not the value.\n",
        "  - Returns True if both refer to the exact same object.\n",
